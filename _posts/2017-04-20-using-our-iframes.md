## Website interactives

At the D.C. Policy Center we often want to embed a map, some figure with animiation, or
an interactive on our website.  Using WordPress is great for running our website but sometimes
we want a little more control.  For this we use a html element called an iframe.  An iframe allows
the user to embed html code into another webpage, giving us complete control over the embedded
html code. Our iframes directory can be found [here](../iframe-content/iframe-content-base-directory).
