#DC Policy Center
##Datablog
This is the datablog od the DC Policy Center.  We focus on DC policy issues through an
economic and data driven lens.  Our goals include trying to bring data transparency and
accesability to the policy conversation.  This blog is supposed to fill some of the
data and analysis gaps in the District.
