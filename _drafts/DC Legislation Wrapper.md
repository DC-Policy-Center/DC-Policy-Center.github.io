For about six months now the D.C. Policy Center has automated the pulling of new legislation for analysis.  This is made simple through a combination of the convenient [API](http://lims.dccouncil.us/api) that is provided through  [D.C. LIMS](http://lims.dccouncil.us/) (Legislation Information Management System) and an internally written python wrapper.
