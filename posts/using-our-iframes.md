## Website interactives

At the D.C. Policy Center we often want to embed a map, some figure with animiation, or
an interactive on our website.  Using WordPress is great for running our website but sometimes
we want a little more control.  For this we use a html element called an iframe.  An iframe allows
the user to embed html code into another webpage, giving us complete control over the embedded
html code.  [iframes](../iframe-content/iframe-content-base-directory)
